      <p><em>The full title is quite the mouthful. &ldquo;Outwitting Squirrels: 101 Cunning Stratagems to Reduce Dramatically the Egregious Misappropriation of Seed from Your Birdfeeder by Squirrels&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Do squirrels always seem one step ahead of the game to you? I know they did for me&hellip; but after this book, I can call them thoroughly and utterly outwitted.</p>
<p>Honestly, I can say that now as I walk down the street, the squirrels turn their heads as to not make eye contact. It&rsquo;s truly a liberating feeling.</p>
<p>There are, as the title suggests a full 101 stratagems within these 240 pages, and honestly, it proves itself to be the best guidebook out there since the 2nd, and 1st edition.</p>

You need to nip it in the bud as soon as possible.</p>

<p>So you&rsquo;re considering eating someone!? You may have also read our previously reviewed <a href="https://alwaysjudgeabookbyitscover.com/how-to-raise-your-i.q.-by-eating-gifted-children/">&ldquo;How to Raise Your IQ by Eating Gifted Children&rdquo;</a> and been swayed by its convincing ways, well it&rsquo;s almost certainly time to consider other options, and this book will be your guiding light to finding them.</p>
<p>This book will take you through the many alternative, including regularly farmed vegetables and meats, processed foods, and raw foods such as grass&hellip; you may find yourself delightfully surprised at the options we have these days.</p>
<p>At the end of the day you <em>are</em> your own person, that said, a deep understanding of the philosophical dilemmas related to cannibalism can never go amiss.</p>

<p>Crafting with Cat Hair is the kind of page-turner that keeps you up at night. Not only will do I love it, but my Cat (always loving the brush) also can&rsquo;t put it down either.</p>
<p>Kaori Tsutaya goes above and beyond in the hunt for literary perfection, covering the topic from the garden of Eden (gathering the cat&rsquo;s hair) right through to the completion of the world (crafting cats from your cats).</p>
<p>The Huffington Post says: “It caught our attention.” &hellip; and that&rsquo;s all you really need to know before you take the leap and join the immensely immense world of crafting with cat hair.</p>

      <p><em>At the end of the day, there&rsquo;s nothing interesting about good taxidermy.</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often overlooked that when you&rsquo;re on your way to mastering an art, you have to sometimes make a few crappy versions of, well, whatever you&rsquo;re working on to get to the top. You won&rsquo;t really be surprised to find that taxidermy is no exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Now, if staring at re-animated animals like that weird guy in American Beauty does it for you, then you&rsquo;re in for a true treat, as Crap Taxidermy puts on display some of the strangest, weirdest, spine-tingling, very often act-against-mother-nature level displays including many a one-eyed beast.</p>
<p>For me though, I consider this book the opposite of a coffee table talk piece. Something that will make your guests perfectly uncomfortable, and make in-laws, who have known you for 10+ years begin to question whether they ever &ldquo;actually&rdquo; knew you at all&hellip;</p>

      <p><em>You may be outwitted by the smart ones, but these ones are more in your grasp.</em></p>
<p>There is a difficult problem to solve in national parks, as people often leave behind (rudely I might add) trash quite often near the trash cans, but surprisingly not always within them, as some of the bins have bear proofing. A park ranger was quoted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a significant overlap between the smartest bears and the dumbest people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This book is for those people (and those bears).</p>
<p>Seriously, if you&rsquo;ve tried birding, but the red cardinal and the blue Herron look no different to you. The nuance of focusing the binoculars escapes you, and you&rsquo;re nearly giving up&hellip; now you can look at birding from a whole different, slightly less sophisticated angle in a way that will bring you joy for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Also good for birder friends who are a little over the top. You know who they are.</p>

      <p><em>Children are the new Super Food.</em></p>
<p>The topic of cannibalism is not a sticky one. It&rsquo;s pretty set in stone, so you won&rsquo;t find any strange information coming from me when it comes down to brass tacks&hellip; that said, in this world&rsquo;s competitive environment, you&rsquo;re going to need to find an edge. And if you don&rsquo;t, someone else will.</p>
<p>That being said, if you are the kind of person who likes to talk about their I.Q. &hellip; perhaps casually bringing it up in conversation at the dinner table, parties, or generally silent rooms, then maybe there is some useful information in here that might pique your fancy, and give you those extra few intelligence quotient points, allowing you to topple the inferior squabble that is the humans of this world.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever needed a reason to kick out your friends and treat yourself to a warm all the way through, slightly soggy meal, well now you have one.</p>
<p>Microwave for One is really the book that put Sonia Allison on the map, some say she meditated alone for in solidarity for an entire year, working her way into a trans-like state and accepting wholly and fully what it is like to be one with the microwave, and then one by one ripped the recipe&rsquo;s out of the void and wrote them into this book.</p>
<p>Each day when I get hungry, I look to the skies and think to myself, &ldquo;What would Sonia Allison do&rdquo;, the path quickly becomes clear, and a soothing wave washes over me as the gentle hum and rotation of the microwave eases my troubled soul.</p>

It&rsquo;s about the cat and mouse that&rsquo;s between a human and a cat. &ldquo;Please for the love of all that is holy let me love you&rdquo; would be the words I would utter within my brain, trying to win the affections of my beloved cat.</p>

<p>Now, my cat and I are two peas in a pod. Dance partners who start with ballroom as the sun goes down&hellip; explore contemporary dance throughout the night, and bring the sun up with a powerful foxtrot.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t sit on the baby is a practical guide to get you through those early days with some very clear do&rsquo;s (feed the baby) and dont&rsquo;s (sit on the baby)&hellip; these are just a couple of little teasers if you want more, and i can tell you do, you&rsquo;re going to have to delve deep into the pages yourself!</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re finished, you&rsquo;ll have a book full of post-its and a solid understanding of how to get your baby out of those baby years, and into those toddler years where you&rsquo;ll find sitting on them is still not a thing you should do.</p>

      <p><em>Yep, It&rsquo;s Wood.</em></p>
<p>You may not know it, but you are surrounded by wood. Your Dining table and chairs? Wood. The walls of your house? Wood. Literally every single tree? Wood.</p>
<p>Oh my, you&rsquo;re realizing that your ability to identify wood might be a little more important than you first thought!</p>
<p>Next, you&rsquo;re going to learn that there are hard and softwoods&hellip; try to fathom the intense power you would have if you could walk into a room and say &ldquo;yep, that&rsquo;s a soft cedar hybrid&rdquo;. Phew, that&rsquo;s a lot of power that needs to be wielded with extreme care.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m imagining the look on your face when, and this is a little spoiler, you then realize that the book itself, in an act of meta genius that would truly make M. Night Shyamalan weep, is also MADE OF WOOD. Yes, just like the mind-warping idea of the brain trying to analyze itself via the medical branch of neurology, this wood is trying to explain to you who it is, and what it is all about!</p>

      <p><em>The perfect guidebook for numbers 0 to 9 in random order!</em></p>
<p>When was the time you read a book that contained every single number in it&hellip; probably never!</p>
<p>Not only does this book contain 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s, but it also has 2&rsquo;s and 3&rsquo;s. In fact, it contains all ten numbers that exist.</p>
<p>Now, the book touts that these digits are in completely random order, but some dark edges of the internet believe there is a pattern in this book, waiting for someone with rain-man like abilities to truly decode its secrets.</p>
<p>Each night, my young son lies eagerly for me to sit and in the most monotone voice read out these numbers. A quick search says it will take approximately 12 days of straight reading to get to the end. I expect to finish by the time he turns 23.</p>

      <p><em>Trumpets, tuxedo&rsquo;s, mushroom&rsquo;s and more.</em></p>
<p>This beautiful pocket guide to mushrooms is one of the most confusing covers that have ever existed, it can only be assumed that upon finishing the book, David Arora, who has has previous mushroom based publications (that themselves have fully sensible covers) realized on his way to perform with his local philharmonic, trumpet in hand reached out into the forrest and ripped up some mushrooms taking careful care not to get any dirt on his freshly rented tuxedo and snapped a quick pic&hellip; sent it off to the publisher and bam, straight onto the cover it went.</p>
<p>All things considered though, while &ldquo;all that rain promised&rdquo; this day was a neat and small guide to local mushrooms, there is a lot of love to this practical guide. With this in your pocket you too should never be too concerned or struggling to identify some special treats whenever you&rsquo;re out with trumpet in hand!</p>

      <p><em>The most boring book, for the most boring person.</em></p>
<p>As someone who prides themselves in collecting strange and boring books, I have to say, this one truly takes the cucumber&hellip; but the process is tedious.</p>
<p>Now. If you love cucumbers, sun, beams, tedious processes, or have family in New Haven then there is a chapter within this marvelous oration for you.</p>
<p>But for real, if you&rsquo;re into 1800&rsquo;s history, and have the true strength of will and mind to look past the red flags that are the cover and title of this wonder, then you&rsquo;re in for a treat; That is, a series of manuscripts for your trouble, providing insights into the lives and troubles of people who would definitely not read this if it was between that and eating 15 raw cucumbers in a row.</p>
